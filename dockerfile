Explanation of the Dockerfile steps:

We use the official Node.js runtime as our base image, specifically Node.js version 14.
We set the working directory inside the container to /app.
We copy package.json and package-lock.json to the working directory.
We run npm install to install the project's dependencies.
We copy the rest of the application code to the working directory. This includes your Next.js application source code.
We run npm run build to build your Next.js application for production. This step is important because it generates the optimized production assets.
We expose port 3000, which is the default port that Next.js applications usually run on.
Finally, we set the CMD instruction to start the Next.js application using npm start when the container is run.
With this Dockerfile in place, you can now build a Docker image for your Next.js app and run it in a Docker container. To build the Docker image, navigate to your project directory and run the following commands:

bash
Copy code
docker build -t my-nextjs-app .
This command will build a Docker image named my-nextjs-app using the Dockerfile in your project directory. After the image is built, you can run a container from it:

bash
Copy code
docker run -p 3000:3000 my-nextjs-app
This will start your Next.js app inside a Docker container, and you can access it in your browser at http://localhost:3000.
